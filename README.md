## About Project 

***_This is only a front end project._***

_For styling the webpages the ```BootStrap``` is imported, and different classes are used to style our ```html``` elements._

_And we tried to show the Menu i.e., a list of food items in ```orderMenu.html``` and when we select them, the selected items are shown in receipt ```receipt.html```._

_This is done by using ```localStorage``` class in js, (refer ```app.js```, ```list.js```)._
